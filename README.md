*"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."*
                                                                    **-Sun Tzu(The Art of War)**

This quote emphasizes the importance of understanding both your opponent and yourself in any adversarial situation. By gaining knowledge of your enemy's tactics, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as understanding your own capabilities and limitations, you can develop effective strategies that increase your chances of success.

### Cryptography Resources -- A must read for anyone interested in Cybersecurity. Read, then read again.
- https://asecuritysite.com/
    - This site was created as there is a real lack of engaging content within the theoretical and practical applications of cryptography on the Internet, especially in covering complex principles in an easy-to-access way. It aims to engage users within the opportunities that cryptography provides in building a more trustworthy and resilient digital world. The site thus contains a wide range of material related to cryptography, security, digital forensics, networking, and many other things.
- https://cryptohack.org/
    - A fun, free platform for learning Modern Cryptography!
    > To make an account you need to decrypt the secret phrase. It is a simple Caesar Cipher, Simply subtract 3 from the index value of each alphabet character to find the original plaintext of each character. Example: `A[0]->D[3]` `Z[25]->C[2]` 
    > Formula: E(X) = (x + n) mod 26 | D(X) = (X - n) mod 26 {E: encryption, D: Decryption, X=unicode ordinal value of characterr
